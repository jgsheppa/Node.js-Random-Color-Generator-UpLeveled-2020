This is a project for the UpLeveled Coding Bootcamp in the Fall of 2020.

If the user enters _node index.js ask_ in the command line, the program will prompt the user for a _hue_.
After the hue is received, the program will prompt the user for a _luminosity_. Once this information
is gathered, the program produces a grid of hashes with a random _hex value_ in its center. For instance,
if the user answers "red" and "light" to the prompts, then a random hex value within the boundary of
the term "light red" will be printed.

See the screenshot below for a visualisation:
